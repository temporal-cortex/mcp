## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- **examples**: LangGraph integration with 4 examples (`examples/langgraph/`): ReAct agent (`simple.py`), Platform Mode (`simple_platform.py`), multi-agent StateGraph (`multi_agent.py`), and human-in-the-loop booking approval (`human_in_the_loop.py`)
- **docs**: LangGraph integration guide (`docs/langgraph-integration.md`)
- **docs**: LangGraph FAQ entry in README with quick-start code for stdio and Platform Mode
- **docs**: Jupyter notebook for LangGraph calendar scheduling (`examples/langgraph/deterministic_calendar_scheduling_with_mcp.ipynb`)
- **hub**: Published scheduling agent prompt to LangSmith Hub at `temporal-cortex/calendar-scheduling-agent`
- **examples**: OpenAI Agents SDK integration with 3 examples (`examples/openai-agents/`): single-agent (`simple.py`), multi-agent hub-and-spoke (`multi_agent.py`), and approval workflow (`human_in_the_loop.py`)

- `TIMEZONE` env var for session-level timezone override
- Streamable HTTP transport mode — set `HTTP_PORT` to serve MCP over HTTP with SSE streaming and session management
- Origin validation middleware (MCP 2025-11-25 §4.3) — rejects cross-origin requests with HTTP 403
- `HTTP_HOST` env var for configurable bind address (default: `127.0.0.1`)
